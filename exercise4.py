# write a console program to simulate calculator
#
# if you type 1+2*3-4 in a python environment,
# it will print out 3
#
# you task is to write a program to
# 1. ask user to input a string, which means should use quotes to wrap
#   input, for example: if you want to calculate 1+1, you should type
#   "1+1"
#
# 2. interpret user input, and calculate the result
#
# 3. only support "+","-","*","/" and integers in the calculation,
#    don't use space or ".", nor other charaters in user input. Otherwise,
#    it will be extremely hard
