import random

# write a function to ask user to type a number.
# 1. this function should generate a random number between 0 and 100
# 2. it should save the number that user typed and check if the number is a real number. 
#    2.1 if the number is not a valid number
#        it should tell user that the number is illegal and ask user to type again
# 3. if the number is valid then compare the number with the generated random number
#    give user hint whether it is too small or too big and ask user to try again
# 4. if the the number is equal to the generated random number, print congratulations 
#    and end the function
